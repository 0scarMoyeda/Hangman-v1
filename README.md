# Hangman-v1
A pygame app completely made by me in my spare time back in March 2023. It's a simple hangman game featuring simple word guessing, and Shrek as the hangman.

The gameplay is simple. Just type a character and press Enter to guess the word.

The word is randomly picked, and like a regular hangman game, if you run out of attempts (meaning the hangman completely hanged), you lose the game. Otherwise, you win.

You can also play again and the word will be randomly choosen again by pressing SPACE
